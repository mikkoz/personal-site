Hi there! This is the personal page of Mikołaj Koziarkiewicz (i.e. myself). It currently serves two purposes:

* as an additional verification point for those wanting to use 
http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22pl.org.miki%22[the Maven artifacts I've created on the `pl.org.miki` namespace],
* as an excuse to start a blog (since I already have a domain and everything...).
