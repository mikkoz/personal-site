We would like to have a game that:

 - requires relatively quick player reaction (so e.g. no turn-based games),
 - has a lot of events happening at any given moment,
 - and employs a large number of entities to do so.

Recall also one of our initial assumptions: mistakes will be made prominent (and prominently made), including potentially avoidable ones, in order to showcase them and their solutions.
