== In this episode...

...we will start the actual development of the game by planting some boilerplate, taking a crash course
in libgdx, and setting the stage for the actual streaming implementation.

== Libgdx Basics

=== Project Structure

http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/[Libgdx^], as mentioned previously, is a popular JVM framework for game design. Rudimentary
Scala support exists - in fact, our game skeleton is based on https://github.com/ajhager/libgdx-sbt-project.g8[ajhager's g8 template^],
or rather, https://github.com/Darkyenus/libgdx-sbt-project.g8[its fork by Darkyenus^].

Because libgdx is a multi-platform engine, projects using it are always multi-module,
split into:

* a `core` module that contains the generic base of the game,
* one or modules, each for a different target's specific code, e.g. `desktop`, `android`, `ios`, etc.

In our case we will be only implementing a desktop version, so we will have two modules:
`core`, and `desktop`.

=== Boilerplate classes

The `core` 's structures starts with the primary entrypoint class - a subclass of `Game`. Each platform
variant creates an instance of this class during initialization.

In turn a `Game` operates on a number of `Screen` s, exactly one of each
is always active. The `Screen` subclasses usually contain most of the game's
logic, the `Game` subclass should only provide minimal global controller "glue".

Both `Game` and `Screen` are coded in by implementing the provided lifecycle methods,
`create`, `pause`, `resume`, `dispose` etc. footnote:[This factory-method-based approach to lifecycle management is quite widespread, and used most prominently in the JVM world by the Android ecosystem].

With the general introduction out of the way, let's see how a minimal game
looks like. Here's the `core` logic:

[source,scala]
----
package net.mikolak.stream_bullethell

import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20
import com.badlogic.gdx.{Game, Gdx, ScreenAdapter}

class BulletHell extends Game {

  override def create(): Unit = { // <1>
    setScreen(new MainScreen) // <2>
  }

}

class MainScreen extends ScreenAdapter { <3>

  override def render(delta: Float) = {
    Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0.5f, 1) // <4>
    Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
  }

}
----
<1> Overriding a lifecycle method here.
<2> Setting the active screen to our implementation.
<3> Using an abstract _Adapter_ class instead of the actual `Screen` interface for convenience.
<4> Painting the background color to dark blue.

We then define a platform specific implementation, in this case,
a "desktop"footnote:[In the "personal computer" sense: anything running on an i386/amd64 architecture or similar.] JRE target:

[source,scala]
-----
package net.mikolak.stream_bullethell

import com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.{LwjglApplication, LwjglApplicationConfiguration} // <1>

object Main extends App {
    val cfg = new LwjglApplicationConfiguration
    cfg.title = "stream-bullethell-demo"
    cfg.height = 480
    cfg.width = 800
    cfg.forceExit = false
    new LwjglApplication(new BulletHell, cfg) <2>
}
-----
<1> "Desktop"-specific imports.
<2> Pointing to our `Game` subclass.

This leaves us with an 800px by 480px screen with a dark blue background.

== Erecting a base camp

The previous listing doesn't leave us much room for experiment, so let's
spice things up a little by adding a proper Hello World message to `MainScreen`:

[source,scala]
----
class MainScreen extends ScreenAdapter {

  private lazy val camera = new OrthographicCamera() // <1>
  private val batch: SpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch() // <2>

  private lazy val font = {
    val f = new BitmapFont()
    f.getData.setScale(2f)
    f
  } // <3>

  override def show() = {
    camera.setToOrtho(false, 800, 480) <4>
  }

  override def render(delta: Float) = {
    Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0.5f, 1)
    Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
    camera.update()
    batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined) <5>
    batch.begin() <6>
    font.draw(batch, "Hello libgdx!", 0, font.getCapHeight) <7>
    batch.end()
  }

}
----
<1> The camera defines how the player "looks" at the object on the scene.
 In this case, we are using an Orthographic camera, which means we're looking
 at the scene "straight down" (representing a 2D game - libgdx is also capable of 3D).
<2> A `SpriteBatch` lets us draw multiple objects in one pass. Due to how actual
games have a lot of objects on screen, using a `SpriteBatch` instance is the standard way
of presenting _anything_ on screen in libgdx.
<3> Fonts, like many other resources, are explicitly declared for efficiency's sake. This
will give us a "default" font.
<4> Once the screen becomes visible, the camera is set to show a top-down view
of a rectangle of `[0, 0, 800, 480]` - since this is the same area as the "desktop"
target's window, each scene point corresponds to a single pixel.
<5> The `SpriteBatch` is ordered to present the same viewport as the camera.
<6> A batch must be always explicitly begun and ended. Objects are queued for drawing with it in between
those two points.
<7> Here's where we actually draw the text. The X coordinate corresponds to the far-left
side of the screen, and the Y coordinate corresponds to the bottom of the screen _plus_ the capital-character height
of glyphs of our font.

This nets us an actual Hello World, but we still have nothing to work on.

== Tick tick tick tick

`Screen` s in libgdx are updated once per an interval called a _tick_. For each tick,
the `render` method is called, and only once it's complete can another tick occurfootnote:[In other words, the `render` method is guaranteed to be called at most once simultaneously - similarly to how `receive` works for Akka actors. This is also how most JVM GUI engines operate.].
This means all your game's logic other than (de)initialization should be called from `render`, and - ideally - run in the same thread.

Due to machine-specific issues or issues with the game logic itself footnote:[As corollary to the above, sluggish game logic in the `render` implementation causes the subsequent call to be delayed.], the length of time
each tick can take is not constant - this is why the `delta` parameter is provided, giving the millisecond amount between current an
previous ticks.

As you have probably figured out by now, we're going to need to tap into the tick mechanism to get started. So, let's end this installment
by printing up subsequent ticks. Here's how our `MainScreen` will look now:

[source,scala]
----
class MainScreen extends ScreenAdapter {

  lazy val camera = new OrthographicCamera()
  val batch: SpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch()

  var tick = 1L

  lazy val font = {
    val f = new BitmapFont()
    f.getData.setScale(2f)
    f
  }

  override def render(delta: Float) = {
    tick += 1 <1>

    //print tick
    Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0.5f, 1)
    Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
    camera.update()
    batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined)
    batch.begin()
    font.draw(batch, s"Tick: $tick", 0, font.getCapHeight) <2>
    batch.end()
  }

  override def show() = {
    camera.setToOrtho(false, 800, 480)
  }
}
----
<1> Setting the tick number...
<2> ...and printing it out.

== Next up

Now we finally have a starting point for actual development of our concept.
In the next installment, which will follow very shortly, we'll get on to do that - specifically, by creating a simple
stream that is able to tap into the tick mechanism of libgdx's engine.
