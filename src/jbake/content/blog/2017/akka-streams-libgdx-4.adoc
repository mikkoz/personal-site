== In this episode...

...we're finally ready to add Akka Streams code to our setup, by implementing the heart of our game logic stream - the
tick `Source`.

include::{jbake_blog_insets_path}akka-streams-libgdx/rules-frame.adoc[]

== Scouting out the solution space

Let's define our core problem first - we need to somehow transfer the information
about each incoming tick into a stream materialization. The first order of business is to find a way
a way to inject that information into the stream.

It's probably tempting to create a custom publisher-listener solution for that, but
we would wind up reinventing the wheel this way. Instead, let's look whether we can find out
how the Akka Streams' API deals with the problem.

As a matter of fact, there is a
link:++http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/current/akka/stream/scaladsl/Source$.html#tick[T](initialDelay:scala.concurrent.duration.FiniteDuration,interval:scala.concurrent.duration.FiniteDuration,tick:T):akka.stream.scaladsl.Source[T,akka.actor.Cancellable]^++[`Source.tick`^] factory method
that handles a similar scenario. However, the ticks here are generated internally, so it's of no use for us.

However, we see that two other useful factory methods exist:

* link:++http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/current/akka/stream/scaladsl/Source$.html#actorPublisher[T](props:akka.actor.Props):akka.stream.scaladsl.Source[T,akka.actor.ActorRef]++[`Source.actorPublisher`^]
* link:++http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/current/akka/stream/scaladsl/Source$.html#actorRef[T](bufferSize:Int,overflowStrategy:akka.stream.OverflowStrategy):akka.stream.scaladsl.Source[T,akka.actor.ActorRef]++[`Source.actorRef`^]

Both provide us with an `ActorRef` that we can use to pump ticks into our stream.

We're going to investigate both to see whether they help us solve our problem, but first, let's...

=== Setup

First of all, that `Float` for the tick delta time looks ungainly, so we'll introduce a package object to deal with that:

[source,scala]
.stream_bullethell/package.scala
----
package net.mikolak

package object stream_bullethell {
  type TickDelta = Float
}
----


Next, let's create a framework for our stream - we're going to be printing ticks from our stream now:

[source,scala]
----
class MainScreen extends ScreenAdapter {

  lazy val camera = new OrthographicCamera()
  val batch: SpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch()

  var tick = 1L

  implicit val actorSystem = ActorSystem("game")
  implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer() <1>

  val tickSource: Source[Nothing, ActorRef] = ??? <3>
  var tickActor: Option[ActorRef] = None <4>

  lazy val font = {
    val f = new BitmapFont()
    f.getData.setScale(2f)
    f
  }

  override def show() = {
    camera.setToOrtho(false, 800, 480)

    val tickSettingFlow = Flow[TickDelta].map { td =>
      tick += 1
      td
    } <5>
    val graph = tickSource.via(tickSettingFlow).to(Sink.ignore) <6>

    tickActor = Some(graph.run()) <7>
  }

  override def render(delta: TickDelta) = {
    tickActor.foreach(_ ! delta) <8>

    //print tick
    Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0.5f, 1)
    Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
    camera.update()
    batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined)
    batch.begin()
    font.draw(batch, s"Tick: $tick", 0, font.getCapHeight)
    batch.end()
  }

  override def dispose(): Unit = {
    actorSystem.terminate() <2>
  }
}
----
<1> Standard initialization song-and-dance.
<2> Deinit here footnote:[This is actually incorrect, but the error is not critical for our purposes.].
<3> Placeholder for our `Source`, note the materialized value type (`ActorRef`).
<4> Placeholder for the materialized value.
<5> Defining a simple `Flow` that increments the `tick` value from the Stream level, and passing the `TimeDelta` value through.
<6> Connecting all parts...
<7> ...and materializing the graph with `run`.
<8> Here's where we communicate the occurrence of a tick with the stream.

The concept is straightforward: we're using a http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/stream/stream-composition.html#materialized-values[materialized value^] (an `ActorRef`) to ping the source
with a tick delta time every time a tick occurs.

[NOTE]
====
What's important to be aware here is that, in Akka Streams, the value materialized from running footnote:[*also* confusingly called "materializing"....]
a graph is not only used to get some output out of it, but can also be used to
provide input _into_ it. This is what we are doing here - once the graph is ran,
the `ActorRef` we get as the result serves as our "messenger" between our libgdx code and the
Akka Stream graph.

You can play around with the source code for this stage {githubprefix}/8a386d516535df51be8ff3920f09c743d334df21[here^].

=== `Source.actorPublisher`

To use this method, we need to implement an actor with an `ActorPublisher` trait.

Basically, we need to create a simple queue implementation that pushes new items
using `onNext`, whenever there is demand downstream. Here's how the implementation might look like:

[source,scala]
----
class GameTickPublisherActor() extends Actor with ActorPublisher[TickDelta] {

  private var updateStack = List.empty[TickDelta]

  override def receive = {
    case delta: TickDelta =>
      updateStack :+= delta <1>

      if (isActive && totalDemand > 0) { <2>
        val (toTransmit, toPreserve) =
          updateStack.splitAt((updateStack.length - totalDemand.toInt).max(0))
        toTransmit.foreach(onNext) <3>
        updateStack = toPreserve
      }
  }
}
----
<1> Adding to our element queue.
<2> Checking whether we should push something downstream.
<3> Transmitting `totalDemand` elements to the upstream.

(Note that `onNext`, `isActive` and `totalDemand` are all references introduced by the `ActorPublisher` trait)

Then, all we need to do is fill out our `Source` placeholder in `MainScreen`:

[source,scala]
----
  val tickSource: Source[Nothing, ActorRef] = Source.actorPublisher(Props[GameTickPublisherActor])
----

{githubprefix}/1b9e74efa6f4f9eb3331fdcc7c657971da93d4da[Here's the source code for this implementation^].

And we're getting our ticks:

video::source-actorpublisher.mp4[width=852,options="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

At first glance, it looks like it's working, although not completely smoothly. Let's try out the other approach.


=== `Source.actorRef`

This one's even simpler, all we have to do is set up the source:

[source,scala]
----
   val tickSource = Source.actorRef[TickDelta](0, OverflowStrategy.dropNew)
----

`actorRef` requires two parameters:

* `bufferSize` - which we set to `0` to disable the buffer,
* `overflowStrategy` - does not actually matter, since buffer is disabled - although `dropNew` is basically the implementation's behavior in this case.

Here's how our tick demonstrator runs now:

video::source-actorref.mp4[width=852,options="autoplay,nocontrols,loop"]

And {githubprefix}/bca4fcd740c0b86af0a07c6e49611b3c67118ab4[here's the source code^].

We can now plainly see that the `actorPublisher` version fails to produce values expediently, compared to
the variant currently discussed. Why is this the case?

=== Keeping things simple

Obviously there's a problem somewhere with the first implementation, but where?
Let's start with logging `toTransmit` on every tick. It turns out we will get something like:

[source,scala]
----
List()
List()
List()
List()
List()
List(0.01748508)
List(0.016564002, 0.015894385)
List(0.017008292, 0.017062303, 0.015971143)
List(0.01700024, 0.01696568, 0.016022582, 0.01697306)
----

This is obviously incorrect, since we should always check for a positive demand (and therefore
should be sending non-empty lists).

Of course, this implies we have the third member of the unholy duo of programming mistakes, namely
an off-by-one error. Specifically, here:

[source,scala]
-----
          updateStack.splitAt((updateStack.length - totalDemand.toInt).max(0))
-----

we `max` to `0` instead of `1`. Correcting the line to `max(1)` will make both implementations run smoothly.

Moreover, seeing as how the `actorPublisher` implementation has no advantage over
the `actorRef` one, and is substantially more convoluted, we'll be sticking with the latter.

== Up next

We now have a tick source, so we will be able to liven our game's world
a little by adding some entities mulling about.

Also, we have completely neglected thread safety up until now - we've been
updating the game state (in this case, the `tick` var) from at least
two different threads. We'll be working towards eliminating this kludge as well.

Stay tuned!
