== Intro

Have you ever:

- regretted that you only remember some bare trivia from a course or a book that you studied several months ago? Or
 maybe even stuff from university/college that you wish you'd recall now?
- constantly annoy yourself with looking up some implementation detail, API definition or another fact,
 that you need every couple of weeks, but juuuust manage to slip your mind the next time you require it?
- feel like learning new stuff (perhaps to progress beyond your current job) is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus[Sisyphean]
 task that doesn't net you anything?

If so, than this article is for you.

.Intended audience
****

While the bulk of this article offers general information, the examples are tailored towards programmers, specifically
 https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Java_virtual_machine&oldid=659766895[JVM] polyglot programmers. You have been warned.
****

== The Perils of Ad-Hoc Learning

The nice thing about living now is having slightly more free time for your basic non-survival needs. The absolutely
scary thing, in turn, is that the amount of information you have access to, and can gain, is simply overwhelming. Understandably
this becomes even worse for IT professionals, what with a new library/framework coming out every week footnote:[and a Javascript implementation following up
in 5 days.].

Of course, a lot of this information is fire-and-forget. Another portion you use day to day and, by this virtue, remember
without any problems.

What's left can be divided into two broad categories.

One is knowledge that you use in irregular, but relatively frequent intervals. An example would be an API quirk that
you keep re-reading about every couple of weeks. Irritating, isn't it? Also wasteful.

The other contains "core" knowledge - stuff that you're not _necessarily_ using directly, but nevertheless benefit from
recalling it readily. Forgetting this kind of information is much more insidious - you just end up doing stuff less effectively; or, perhaps
one day you suddenly realize that you completely forgot all the things you wanted to learn from the course you did half a
  year ago.


.But, but, the Internet!
****

A commonly raised counterargument against investing time in recall methods boils down to:

> Why bother? Everything is on the Internet anyway, if I don't remember something, I'll just look it up!

And sure, you can do that. But how much does it cost you?

Here's the example for the majority of you reading this that are coders: how to write a binary literal in Java? Regardless of whether
you know this or not, take your favorite stopwatch app footnote:[I expect very few people still have actual stopwatches, digital or analog.],
and try out finding the answer on the Internet.

I'd be willing to bet that for most of you, the total time between switching away from this article, and returning to it after searching will
be slightly north of 10 seconds.

That's not a lot, right? But those search bits add up during the day, *and* you need to factor in the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_switching[context switch] costs
footnote:[Also, let's not kid ourselves, you probably took this as a challenge and done the search than you would normally do under
 this kind of situation.].

Now try to recall the answer to the question, again: "how to write a binary literal in Java?". It probably took you less than a second to
remember. That is an order of magnitude of a difference. Making a somewhat strained analogy, it's quite similar to the difference between
reading from disk and reading from RAM.

Of course, you're still spending time by putting additional effort into knowledge retention - but that's _dedicated_ time,
as opposed to hacking up your work routine into disjointed bits.
****

== Spaced Repetition - a solution

Obviously no one is going to sit around every day working on remember their cumulatively growing knowledge by rote.

But there are shortcuts to do something very similar much more efficiently.

The concept of https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaced_repetition&oldid=656222625[Spaced Repetition] offers one such
shortcut. There are many implementations exploiting the idea, but they all boil down to taking advantage of
  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spacing_effect&oldid=635962055[particularities of the human brain] in order to
  achieve effective recall of various facts and concepts, with relatively minimal effort.

== An SR-based approach

One such implementation is http://ankisrs.net/[Anki]. It's https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flashcard&oldid=653079387[flashcard]-based
spaced repetition software. The tl;dr version of the process of working with flashcards and SRS looks like this:

* you create a flashcard. In the simplest version it's a note with two faces: the prompt for what you want to learn, and
 the thing you want to learn. Here's a couple of examples.

image::anki-cards-overview.png[align="center", height="343", width="1080", title="A selection of Anki cards: normal text, source code, image, LaTeX formulas."]

* after several initial repetitions, Anki prompts you with the cards, in increasing time intervals: initially a couple of days,
 then a couple of weeks, months, and so on. At each repetition, when viewing the answer, you are prompted to choose one of the following options:
** "Again" which means you forgot about the entry, and need to reset the learning process,
** "Good" meaning you have good recollection, i.e. the vanilla option,
** "Hard" implying that you've _sorta_ learned, but aren't quite confident, leading to a shorter time to repetition,
** "Easy" that tells the system to extend the time interval to a greater extent than with "Good".

As you have probably figured it out, the biggest benefit from this system is that the time intervals are managed automatically, and you get
automatic reminders to repeat your cards (which is especially useful if you install the mobile client).

.Local Flavor
****
Anki's repetition selection algorithm is a derivative of https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SuperMemo&oldid=618419134[SM2],
which was invented in Poland.

== The Scheme

Based on using Anki for knowledge retention, I've developed a learning scheme to keep myself from forgetting the stuff
I'd rather remember. Given a new source material (e.g. a book, an online course), here's how it looks like.

=== Step 0: Choose what to learn

Probably the most important step - you need to *consciously*, and *responsibly*, ask yourself the question: "what knowledge do I need to retain
effectively"? This is something that you optimally should work out for yourself.

However, I can provide three pointers:

- The best fit should align with one of the two categories I've described in the <<the_perils_of_ad_hoc_learning,introductory sections>>.
- You already need to *understand* whatever you're trying to recall - the scheme I'm describing want help you with that.
- *Don't* start with adding "feel-good stuff" - knowledge that you always wanted to recall off the top of your head in order to impress yourself.
You'll most likely, eventually get frustrated and see the exercise as a waste of time. Do begin with applying this learning method to things
 you actually *need*.


=== Step 1: Highlight Key Passages (Optional)

This is of course only relevant for textual sources. I still recommend it whenever you're learning from those, because
it helps you stay in the flow.

=== Step 2: Create Mind-map-like notes

Regularly, for each piece of content (video for online courses, chapter for a book, etc.), add notes to a mind map describing
the thing you're currently learning about footnote:[I usually keep a map e.g. per book.].

This may seem like a superfluous step, but it helps in three things:

- it actually helps with knowledge retention by preliminarily organizing it,
- it makes the next step go faster, since you don't have to re-read/-watch the entire content,
- most importantly, it helps to verify whether you've understood what you're learning about. You will very likely to see
 that you're e.g. writing nonsense at this point, and it's less frustrating to identify it and fix it than in the next
 step.


NOTE: I say "mind-map-like" because someone might argue that the notes might not necessarily look like a "proper" mind map, i.e.
there are no colors, graphics, etc. Nevertheless, I think the form of a tree, which mindmaps take, is the most conducive
 to general, rapid note-taking.

For the actual mind mapping I prefer to use http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page[Freemind]. It's open source,
free, multiplatform, and offers a set of convenient keyboard shortcuts for quick note-taking.

image::freemind-example.png[align="center", role="thumb", title="A mind-map example - an (outdated) mind map of Akka documentation."]

=== Step 3: Extract flashcards from the mind map in Anki Desktop

Now that you have rapid-access notes, it's time to go through them and create the flashcards. We'll mostly be dealing with
"classic cards", i.e. with two faces - an entry, and whatever you should recall according regarding the entry. However, there
are also other types: reversed (where the "entry"-"recall" relation is bilateral, effectively doubling the given card), and cloze
completion, where you "fill" in text (useful for e.g. learning phrases in foreign languages).

Also, you can insert almost everything into a card, including:

- plain and formatted texts,
- pictures,
- sounds,
- LaTeX, including complex formulas in math mode,
- source code, https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/491274358[with the correct plugin] footnote:[Did I mention Anki has https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/[a large
plugin directory]?].

See the figure <<an_sr_based_approach,in the introductory section>> for some examples.

=== Step 4: Learn from flashcards in the Anki Mobile Client(s)

image::anki-learning-example.png[float="right", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="Reviewing a card in Anki."]

Whereas the Desktop client is more conducive to creating (and reviewing) cards, I find it much better to actually learn
by using the Anki software on mobile devices (iOS/Android footnote:[While the Android version is completely Open Source, the
iOS version is paid-for, and, in fact, the latter is currently the main source of monetary support from the project.]).

Principally, this is because, with the mobile client, you have less distractions. And trust me, during the beginnings,
once the initial enthusiasm wears out but _before_ you see tangible benefits, you will need all the focus you can get.

Another, equally important thing is that you will have access to the cards wherever you go. This makes it an easier to
form the habit of reviewing the cards daily, especially in the case of the Android client, where you can also add a widget
to your home screen.

=== Step 5: Review, Heal, and Grow your flashcard "Deck"

Your cards, once created, should _not_ be treated as if set in stone. Splitting a card, improving it, suspending it, or removing
it altogether should all be options you need to consider.

== Enough theory, time for practice

=== Step 0: Choose what to learn

For this article, I've decided to use the example of http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_matchers[ScalaTest matchers].
That topic makes a good example, because:

- the subjects squarely in the category of "in one ear, out the other" ,
- remembering brings a tangible benefit - reports for the specialised matchers are more meaningful than those from a simple `should be equal`.

Let's start, shall we?

=== Step 1: Highlight Key Passages (Optional)

The matcher documentation (again, http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_matchers[available here]) is actually a
good case where this step can be skipped. The docs are compact, information-rich, and the most notable facts are plainly
 visible.

=== Step 2: Create Mind-map-like notes

First of all, we're not actually going to do the full docs, just enough to create a relatively good example. So, let's do
the first 3 sections, up to and including "checking strings".

Here's how a note-centered mind map might look like:

image::freemind-scalatest.png[align="center", role="thumb", title="The resultant mind map."]

You might notice the following things:

- consistently with "normal" mind maps, items progressively become less general and more specific the further away from the center,
- also like "normal" mind maps, items connected "physically" are also related semantically footnote:[There are no additional connections in this particular example, but, in
general, it's OK to make them.],
- _unlike_ typical mind maps, there very little formatting and decorations were applied. This is because the map is intended to be a transitory step,
and not something you will revisit often. Normally, the only formatting I do is hyperlinks and icons for denoting especially important stuff.
- only a portion of the information from the doc page is included. It's a deliberate decision - the goal is to provide a source for
 quickly writing up cards, which are supposed to help you in the long-term - so we're looking for stuff that's most useful. In other words,
 we need the info for your regular life/work, and *not* to prepare for a fire-and-forget exam.

=== Step 3: Extract flashcards from the mind map in Anki Desktop

Let's open https://ankisrs.net/[Anki] Desktop now. First, click `Create Deck` footnote:[A deck is simply a collection of Anki cards.]. Since I already have a `Scala` deck,
I'm going to make a subdeck, which is done by writing `Scala::ScalaTest`. After the deck is created, click on it.

image::anki-newdeck.png[align="center", height="1", width="720", title="Ready to add cards."]

Now, we're ready to create the cards proper. Click on `Add` at the top footnote:[Yes, the Anki UI is sometimes all over the place.].

image::anki-newcard.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="New card to be filled out."]

You'll be presented with a view similar to the above (the additional UI elements mostly come from the https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/491274358[source code plugin]).

We're going to out of order and start with the second point - asserting size and/or length - since it's more straightforward. Let's start with the length:

 - Front: I recommend this to be titled in the way that is the most similar to how you'd try to recall the relevant information. In this case, I'd
 write "ScalaTest - asserting length".
 - Back: this should contain the relevant information in the most concise way. In this case, all we need is the text of the assert, e.g. `have length X`
 footnote:[Pardon the faint red markings on the illustration - there seems to be a bug in the Anki Linux
 client that makes disabling the spellcheck impossible, hence a quick photoedit job.].

image::anki-newcard-filled.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="Card filled out."]

Now, do the same for asserting size. Here you might think whether it wouldn't be more efficient to store both pieces of information in a single card. In
practice, I find that it's much more worthwhile to split information into as many cards as possible, as simple cards are much easier to learn and hence
produce a better retention effect.

Going up next, we have the string comparisons. Here, I'd suggest to create 8 cards:

 - 3 per each "simple" matcher
 - 4 per each "regex" matcher
 - 1 for the `withGroups` matcher qualifier.

image::anki-card-simple-filled.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="Simple comparison, note slogan-like front naming."]

After that, we've got comparisons. Here, I'm going to create just two cards, one per every strict/equal-or pair, since the cases appear to be both
semantically and "graphically" coupled.

image::anki-card-standard.png[align="center", height="1",width="500", title="Two pieces of info, but still pretty straightforward."]

Note that here I'm omitting the `Ordering[T]` information, as I'm making the assumption that I can rely on the compiler for recalling that tidbit.
_However_, if you e.g. use lots of custom classes with dedicated `Ordering` implementations, creating an additional card might be worth your while.

Finally, let's go back to the general equality case. The `be` card is pretty straightforward:

image::anki-card-complex-entry.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="Simple equality."]

However, for the `equal` we have to cram some info on the back:

image::anki-card-complex.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="The most complex card type you should be making."]

This is unfortunate, however sometimes you have pieces of information that are inseparable.

And there you have it! If you want to study using the cards created for this section, download link:{imagesdir}Scala__ScalaTest.apkg[the pack from here].

=== Step 4: Learn from flashcards in the Anki Mobile Client(s)

Now that we've created the cards, we can move to actually using them. For that, you'll need to:

. Get the mobile client, in either the https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki[Android] or
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4[iOS] versions
. Set up http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#ankiweb-and-synchronization[AnkiWeb synchronization] between your desktop client
and your mobile device.

IMPORTANT: Please be aware of the https://ankiweb.net/account/terms[content policies] before you sync data through AnkiWeb.

Now that you've set it up, and open the synced deck, you should see something like the following:

image::anki-mobile-starting.png[align="left", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="Before..."]

image::anki-mobile-starting-answer.png[align="right", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="...and after the first answer."]

You're viewing a new card in the learning stage, which will require at least one repetition on the same day. Always choose the
option that authentically reflects your recall ability of that card. Eventually, you should arrive at something similar to
the following screen:

image::anki-mobile-final-review.png[align="center", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="Last answer for now. Note the different time periods."]

Now the choices extend beyond the same day. If your recall is increased effectively, the interval selection will lengthen at
a geometric rate. So when in doubt, answer pessimistically - it won't "cost" you much time.

.Use the Widget
****
If you're using Android, the widget is a nice feature. It shows you the amount of pending cards for the day, as well
as the projected time required for going over them.
****

=== Step 5: Review, Heal, and Grow your flashcard "Deck"

This is probably the most personalized of the steps. However, a couple common issues might manifest, most notably:

==== Errors on the cards

Factual, typographical or otherwise: minor ones can be remedied immediately through the mobile client, but
for more complex stuff, your best bet is to mark the card by favoriting it, and potentially http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#editing-and-more[burying the card], "postponing" it
to the following day, if the problem is severe enough so that you can't meaningfully review the card footnote:[Often happens with formulas encoded in LaTeX, as the mobile client
 is notoriously fickle when displaying them.].

image::anki-bury-favorite.png[float="right", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="`Hide/Delete` will show `Bury`."]

==== Lack of perceived benefit from using the cards for a _particular_ topic

This mostly stems from not enough understanding
of the subject matter. With this method, always try to make a conscious effort to actually _comprehend_ and _integrate_ the source material.
This even applies to our relatively simple example - the retention effect for the ScalaTest will be much greater if you practice
writing the matcher expressions during the the initial days.

==== General frustration

In other words, the bog standard reaction to a new habit that one is trying to form. After the initial enthusiasm dwindles,
the act of repeating the cards might appear like a chore. In this case, I advise you to

- simply stick it out if you're only a couple of weeks in,
- be honest - if you forgot the card's content, choose "Again",
- otherwise try to remember situations where the use of this technique has improve recall, and
- take note of how much time have you've already spent by using this method footnote:[Yes, I'm basically suggesting an abuse of humanity's
 susceptibility to the https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gambler%27s_fallacy&oldid=663853840[Gambler's Fallacy].].

==== Recalling knowledge you no longer need

It happens, whether when studying for actual exams, investing in learning a technology that
didn't pan out, or for other reasons. In this case, you just need to http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#editing-and-more[suspend]
the relevant cards, causing them to no longer appear until they're manually resumed.

==== Amassing a huge backlog

- To prevent that, start small (<100 cards total) until you get the gist of it, and try to set aside
 some regularly scheduled period in your daily routine for the card review - for example, during your daily commute footnote:[Which was how I started.].
- To resolve it, just chip away at the mass of cards for several days. Due to how the SRS algorithm works, you are bound to eventually reduce the
 backlog to a manageable size.

== So how does it work out, really?

While I can't offer you any peer-reviewed, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment#Double-blind_trials[double-blind] study on the
validity of the method I've described above. _Subjectively_ however, I can tell you that I am convinced adopting the technique has had
a great effect on improving the time effectiveness of learning stuff I want to know. Without fail, for every such source, whether
a book, a course, technical documentation or otherwise, I have progressed beyond just that "feel-good" sensation and actually was able
 to recall the most important information many, many months after first absorbing it.

However, I do have some objective, if not statistically representative, data. Take a look at the following figures, which describe
 the total time and total number of card reviews throughout my entire usage history, with my ~850 card collection, grown over time:

image::anki-stats.png[align="center", role="thumb", title="Stats since day 1. Note the time per day."]

As you can see, the amount of time per day, even if artificially inflated by the aforementioned commuting, is laughably small
when compared to the benefits. The benefits themselves, in turn, are indirectly demonstrated by the portion of "relearn" (i.e. "I forgot all
about it") card reviews in the overall scheme - Anki/SRS really is that effective in helping you remember footnote:[A recent example - after preparing a
simple deck, and some minimal practice, I was able to write complex MongoDB aggregations off the top of my head, many months after completing the related
online course.].

== In closing

It would be a disservice to Anki if I'd fail to mention that it is also an excellent tool for helping in learning a language. Anki was, after all,
 https://groups.google.com/d/msg/anki-users/M8mDFN7-H-I/P2bRBmm2aQEJ[originally created to aid its author in studying Japanese].

In fact, a comprehensive collection of community-created decks https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/[has been made available], spanning
 not only multiple languages but also subjects such as Biology, Geography, Physics, and others.

Finally, I hope I have shared some of the enthusiasm for Spaced-Repetition-assisted learning in the context of technical knowledge footnote:[and haven't bored you to tears while
at it.]. I encourage you to try it out for a small dataset, and see how it goes - as long as you have a minimum of self-control and curiosity, you should benefit
from adopting this technique. Maybe it https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Craig_%28Jeopardy!_contestant%29&oldid=651710417#Preparation[won't help *you* win "Jeopardy!"],
but it will certainly provide you with a powerful tool when dealing with the ever increasing corpus of information that must be absorbed in
order to stay up to date, and to keep in touch with the "core" knowledge that serves as the foundation for your daily technical decisions.
