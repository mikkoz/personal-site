== The Setting

I've noticed conference speakers started to badger the audience more and more about the modern classics
of software engineering: _{link_cleanCode}_, _The Pragmatic Programmer_, _Code Complete_, etc.

Since this year's IT book summer sales were especially bountiful in opportunity
footnote:[Yes, such a thing exists - are you really surprised?],
I've decided to correct this long-standing knowledge deficiency and _buy all the books_.

I'm currently starting _Code Complete_, but what I wanted to talk about is _{link_theCleanCoder}_. Note the _r_ - this is 
actually a followup to _{link_cleanCode}_, i.e. a distinct book.

Where _{link_cleanCode}_ focuses on the meat of your software engineering job, _{link_theCleanCoder}_ concentrates on 
everything around it, specifically forming an answer to the question: "What does it mean to be a professional programmer?".

Now, Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin is generally well-known in the programming community for his insightful and spot-on 
opinions, so instead of providing yet another full-on review, I'll focus on one thing in the book that struck me 
as potentially, well... harmful.

One of the "professional" qualifiers that Uncle Bob defined is this: as a professional, _you, and you alone_ 
are ultimately responsible for your professional growth. This qualifier, in general, is completely valid to the point
of indisputability.

== The Problem

Unfortunately, it's also originally presented with the subtlety of going sloth-hunting in a Churchill AVRE.

The above statement is best illustrated by the following quote:

"Professional programmers practice on their own time. It is not your employer’s
job to help you keep your skills sharp for you. It is not your employer’s job to
help you keep your resume tuned. Patients do not pay doctors to practice sutures.
Football fans do not (usually) pay to see players run through tires. Concert-goers
do not pay to hear musicians play scales. And employers of programmers don’t
have to pay you for your practice time."
-- Robert C. Martin, The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers


Let's start with the details:

* yes, doctors *get paid* for practicing stitches, as Uncle Bob already points out, it's called "residence",
* yes, team sport players *get paid* for practicing before a match, they have a regular salary,
* yes, musicians *get paid* for practice - granted, not all of them, but the ones hired by an establishment such 
as an philharmonic orchestra do.

But that's just nitpicking - the biggest gripe of mine here is that the standard work of a programmer is compared to a 
_performance_. Uncle Bob himself stresses that overtime is bad and that the typical workload should oscilate at around
40 hours a week. But:

* doctors *don't* normally operate 40 continuous hours a week,
* team sport players *don't* normally have 40 continuous hours worth of matches per week,
* musicians *don't* normally play 40 continuous hours of concerts per week 
footnote:[Short research indicates that the reasonable minimum is several concerts _per month_. In fairness, 
the salaries tend to be bad enough to often necessitate taking on additional work.].

In fact, in two-thirds of those jobs, the "practice" part is completely integrated into day-to-day work 
footnote:[Even if not explicitly paid-for, still counts as "work".]. 
Why expect something different from programmers then?

Now, here's the twist - it doesn't appear that that's what Uncle Bob means at all, and it is simply a case of a misasdjusted
analogy. The problem is it becomes apparent only late in the book.

In the final chapter, Mr. Martin talks at length about mentoring - not only self-mentoring, but also explictly _training
newcomers to be set in the path of professionalism and software craftsmanship_.

Then it becomes apparent that we're not talking about practice in general. Rather, here's what the proposed rule appears to
be:

* while your _personal_ development in the context of your _chosen career path_ is solely in your hands,
* any research, prototyping, training that's _pertinent to the job_ does not automatically become "personal development".

So yeah, that's mostly clear. My only worry is that we now have an ammunition stockpile for irresponsible managers and 
the relic "cowboy" programmers who might use it to say:

"A prototype? A spike for that technology _[that is relevant to solving the problem, but we haven't used it yet]_? That's
personal development, do it in your own time!"

Utter BS, I know, but my heart bleeds for any junior programmers who would have to weather it, or rather, wade through it.

== The Conclusion

However, it has to be stressed: *both _{link_cleanCode}_ and _{link_theCleanCoder}_
are absolutely brilliant books and a must-read for any professional programmer*. 

A very cool thing is Uncle Bob working very hard at not pretending he's some messiah descending from on high, fully 
formed as a software craftsman. He virtually makes a _point_ of showcasing the mistakes he made during his career,
which both serves as case studies to learn from, and as a humanizing "hook" to the principles he's promoting.

One particular example that caught my attention was with the misguided fascination on UML-based CASE tools during the 90s 
(and implicitly early 00s). Boy, was I glad to hear I was in good company drinking that particular Kool-Aid...

Both books are written in an ultra-accessible style that makes them perfect to read anywhere 
without loss of comprehension footnote:[and effectively emulates the coding style espoused in _Clean Code_ in writing.], so 
there's really no excuse to hold it off because "you don't have time to focus".

With these books, there's no need to focus. As presented in this blog entry, you do need to critically digest 
 what they say footnote:[The author says as much, multiple times.], but background-process-style thinking 
should be a second nature if you're a programmer, right?

== A Footnote

A professional cares for his toolset. For coders, the toolset is his/hers total sum of knowledge and skills, and it's true
that it *is the coder's responsibility*, ultimately, to take good care of them.

However, for a professional leader (manager, company owner etc.) the toolset are the people he/she leads. It is, therefore,
completely reasonable for said leader to display the same amount of care as the professional coder does - which implies
acknowledging the need for job-relevant skill development.

I'd argue that's what missing from _The Clean Coder_ is this interaction aspect - it's not enough to maintain a work ethic,
you also have to be responsible for choosing your battles.
