== Previously

http://mikołak.net/blog/2015/srs-assisted-learning-scheme-theory.html[During the last episode], we've discussed a learning scheme that
can help you to avoid having most acquired information from floating away.

In what follows, we'll use an example to walk through the scheme step by step.

.Intended audience
****

While the bulk of this series offers information that should be useful for virtually everyone, the examples below are tailored towards programmers,
specifically https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Java_virtual_machine&oldid=659766895[JVM] polyglot programmers. You have been warned.
****

== Enough theory, time for practice

=== Step 0: Choose what to learn

For this article, I've decided to use the example of http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_matchers[ScalaTest matchers].
That topic makes a good example, because:

- the subjects squarely in the category of "in one ear, out the other" ,
- remembering brings a tangible benefit - reports for the specialised matchers are more meaningful than those from a simple `should be equal`.

Let's start, shall we?

=== Step 1: Highlight Key Passages (Optional)

The matcher documentation (again, http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_matchers[available here]) is actually a
good case where this step can be skipped. The docs are compact, information-rich, and the most notable facts are plainly
 visible.

=== Step 2: Create Mind-map-like notes

*Before we start, if you don't have a favorite mind-mapping application,
http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download[download and install Freemind].*

First of all, we're not actually going to do the full docs, just enough to create a relatively good example. So, let's do
the first 3 sections, up to and including "checking strings".

Here's how a note-centered mind map might look like:

image::freemind-scalatest.png[align="center", role="thumb", title="The resultant mind map."]

You might notice the following things:

- consistently with "normal" mind maps, items progressively become less general and more specific the further away from the center,
- also like "normal" mind maps, items connected "physically" are also related semantically footnote:[There are no additional connections in this particular example, but, in
general, it's OK to make them.],
- _unlike_ typical mind maps, there very little formatting and decorations were applied. This is because the map is intended to be a transitory step,
and not something you will revisit often. Normally, the only formatting I do is hyperlinks and icons for denoting especially important stuff.
- only a portion of the information from the doc page is included. It's a deliberate decision - the goal is to provide a source for
 quickly writing up cards, which are supposed to help you in the long-term - so we're looking for stuff that's most useful. In other words,
 we need the info for your regular life/work, and *not* to prepare for a fire-and-forget exam.

=== Step 3: Extract flashcards from the mind map in Anki Desktop

*If you haven't done so already, http://ankisrs.net/#download[download and install Anki on your computer].*

First, click `Create Deck` footnote:[A deck is simply a collection of Anki cards.]. Since I already have a `Scala` deck,
I'm going to make a subdeck, which is done by writing `Scala::ScalaTest`. After the deck is created, click on it.

image::anki-newdeck.png[align="center", height="1", width="720", title="Ready to add cards."]

Now, we're ready to create the cards proper. Click on `Add` at the top footnote:[Yes, the Anki UI is sometimes all over the place.].

image::anki-newcard.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="New card to be filled out."]

You'll be presented with a view similar to the above (the additional UI elements mostly come from the https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/491274358[source code plugin]).

We're going to out of order and start with the second point - asserting size and/or length - since it's more straightforward. Let's start with the length:

 - Front: I recommend this to be titled in the way that is the most similar to how you'd try to recall the relevant information. In this case, I'd
 write "ScalaTest - asserting length".
 - Back: this should contain the relevant information in the most concise way. In this case, all we need is the text of the assert, e.g. `have length X`
 footnote:[Pardon the faint red markings on the illustration - there seems to be a bug in the Anki Linux
 client that makes disabling the spellcheck impossible, hence a quick photoedit job.].

image::anki-newcard-filled.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="Card filled out."]

Now, do the same for asserting size. Here you might think whether it wouldn't be more efficient to store both pieces of information in a single card. In
practice, I find that it's much more worthwhile to split information into as many cards as possible, as simple cards are much easier to learn and hence
produce a better retention effect.

Going up next, we have the string comparisons. Here, I'd suggest to create 8 cards:

 - 3 per each "simple" matcher
 - 4 per each "regex" matcher
 - 1 for the `withGroups` matcher qualifier.

image::anki-card-simple-filled.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="Simple comparison, note slogan-like front naming."]

After that, we've got comparisons. Here, I'm going to create just two cards, one per every strict/equal-or pair, since the cases appear to be both
semantically and "graphically" coupled.

image::anki-card-standard.png[align="center", height="1",width="500", title="Two pieces of info, but still pretty straightforward."]

Note that here I'm omitting the `Ordering[T]` information, as I'm making the assumption that I can rely on the compiler for recalling that tidbit.
_However_, if you e.g. use lots of custom classes with dedicated `Ordering` implementations, creating an additional card might be worth your while.

Finally, let's go back to the general equality case. The `be` card is pretty straightforward:

image::anki-card-complex-entry.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="Simple equality."]

However, for the `equal` we have to cram some info on the back:

image::anki-card-complex.png[align="center", height="1", width="500", title="The most complex card type you should be making."]

This is unfortunate, however sometimes you have pieces of information that are inseparable.

And there you have it! If you want to study using the cards created for this section, download link:{imagesdir}Scala__ScalaTest.apkg[the pack from here].

=== Step 4: Learn from flashcards in the Anki Mobile Client(s)

Now that we've created the cards, we can move to actually using them. For that, you'll need to:

. Get the mobile client, in either the https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki[Android] or
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4[iOS] versions
. Set up http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#ankiweb-and-synchronization[AnkiWeb synchronization] between your desktop client
and your mobile device.

IMPORTANT: Please be aware of the https://ankiweb.net/account/terms[content policies] before you sync data through AnkiWeb.

Now that you've set it up, and open the synced deck, you should see something like the following:

image::anki-mobile-starting.png[align="left", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="Before..."]

image::anki-mobile-starting-answer.png[align="right", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="...and after the first answer."]

You're viewing a new card in the learning stage, which will require at least one repetition on the same day. Always choose the
option that authentically reflects your recall ability of that card. Eventually, you should arrive at something similar to
the following screen:

image::anki-mobile-final-review.png[align="center", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="Last answer for now. Note the different time periods."]

Now the choices extend beyond the same day. If your recall is increased effectively, the interval selection will lengthen at
a geometric rate. So when in doubt, answer pessimistically - it won't "cost" you much time.

.Use the Widget
****
If you're using Android, the widget is a nice feature. It shows you the amount of pending cards for the day, as well
as the projected time required for going over them.

=== Step 5: Review, Heal, and Grow your flashcard "Deck"

This is probably the most personalized of the steps. However, a couple common issues might manifest, most notably:

==== Errors on the cards

Factual, typographical or otherwise: minor ones can be remedied immediately through the mobile client, but
for more complex stuff, your best bet is to mark the card by favoriting it, and potentially http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#editing-and-more[burying the card], "postponing" it
to the following day, if the problem is severe enough so that you can't meaningfully review the card footnote:[Often happens with formulas encoded in LaTeX, as the mobile client
 is notoriously fickle when displaying them.].

image::anki-bury-favorite.png[float="right", width="230", height="1", role="thumb", title="`Hide/Delete` will show `Bury`."]

==== Lack of perceived benefit from using the cards for a _particular_ topic

This mostly stems from not enough understanding
of the subject matter. With this method, always try to make a conscious effort to actually _comprehend_ and _integrate_ the source material.
This even applies to our relatively simple example - the retention effect for the ScalaTest will be much greater if you practice
writing the matcher expressions during the the initial days.

==== General frustration

In other words, the bog standard reaction to a new habit that one is trying to form. After the initial enthusiasm dwindles,
the act of repeating the cards might appear like a chore. In this case, I advise you to

- simply stick it out if you're only a couple of weeks in,
- be honest - if you forgot the card's content, choose "Again",
- otherwise try to remember situations where the use of this technique has improve recall, and
- take note of how much time have you've already spent by using this method footnote:[Yes, I'm basically suggesting an abuse of humanity's
 susceptibility to the https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gambler%27s_fallacy&oldid=663853840[Gambler's Fallacy].].

==== Recalling knowledge you no longer need

It happens, whether when studying for actual exams, investing in learning a technology that
didn't pan out, or for other reasons. In this case, you just need to http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#editing-and-more[suspend]
the relevant cards, causing them to no longer appear until they're manually resumed.

==== Amassing a huge backlog

- To prevent that, start small (<100 cards total) until you get the gist of it, and try to set aside
 some regularly scheduled period in your daily routine for the card review - for example, during your daily commute footnote:[Which was how I started.].
- To resolve it, just chip away at the mass of cards for several days. Due to how the SRS algorithm works, you are bound to eventually reduce the
 backlog to a manageable size.

== Coming Up

In http://mikołak.net/blog/2015/srs-assisted-learning-stats-and-conclusions.html[the final part of the series], we'll look at some actual statistics related to using Anki, and touch on some miscellaneous
closing points.
